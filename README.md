MVP

- Sort functionality - update API call to sort rather than just individual page

  - ensure working when changing pages

- Add/Remove from temp gallery of saved artwork ('Design should intuitively guide users to search, view, and create curated exhibitions.')

  - Check how to create personal (temp) galleries - use state, create multiple arrays/objects within this? Why one over the other? How would these relate to a database/data table

- Update README (summary, instructions, dependencies and versions, configuring env variables & getting API key)
- Host

ADDITIONAL

- Style Individual art components
- Add loading animation
- Move pagination to separate component to prevent re-render?

FINAL CHECKS

- Responsiveness/Accessibility
- Check error handling
- Remove all console logs
- Remove old API files/env

---

DONE (Check again at end)

- check page loading for search (check both)
- Pagination w/ search
- Add "alt" text for all images - check MDN docs? ARIA link from Wes - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby
  and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility
- Ensure descriptions for individual artworks load/display correctly (Markup coming through?)
