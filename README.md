# MyArtHouse

## Project Summary

MyArtHouse is a platform for users to explore virtual exhibitions and artwork from a combined collection of arthouses and museums. Users can search, filter and browse these artworks and find additional information about each specific piece. Additionally, users can create their own custom collections of art, saving individual artworks into these collections by any criteria they choose, enabling quick and easy viewing.

### Configuring .env Variables and API Keys

To run this project locally, you'll need to create your own .env file at the root of the project directory. This file stores sensitive information like API keys and base URLs used by the application.

- Create a .env file

- Add the following variables:\
  `VITE_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"`\
  `VITE_BASE_URL_HARVARD="https://api.harvardartmuseums.org"`\
  `VITE_BASE_URL_CMA="https://openaccess-api.clevelandart.org/api`"

- Get an API Key
  To use the Harvard Art Museums API, you'll need to sign up and request an API key here:/
  ðŸ”— https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/api

- Replace `"your-api-key-here"` with the API key you receive.

## Roadmap

- Additional sort/filter functionality (API dependent)
